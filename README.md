## HTTP Validator

Executes HTTP requests periodically and performs some basic checks on the response data.

Reads validation task information from an XML file that can be updated independently of the application code 
(restart not needed either).

Run schedule can also be set through a separate configuration file (restart required).

Next steps:
- Parallel task execution
- Offer some  basic processing statistics through the web API
